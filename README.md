# Most of the code comes from the [repository](https://github.com/thinking-tower/Fourier-and-Images.git)

Initally led to this project by watching this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6)

The only thing i wanted was to add lines to the epicycles, to show the rotation and it is captured in a simple way in the file Simple_Epicycles.py

The rest of the code basically comes the first mentioned repository,although made it very simple to whatever i wanted to do and you can find instructions on the page.

Here is an example

I've added a Jupyter [notebook][https://github.com/Jason-George/Epicycles/blob/master/Pre_Process.ipynb] to show some pre_processing work on the image.
